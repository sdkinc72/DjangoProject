### INT. CAMPING GROUND - DAY 1 - LATE AFTERNOON

A small clearing in the forest. **KYLE** (mid-30s, rugged, adventurous) is setting up his tent, quietly humming a tune. He looks like someone who’s comfortable being alone in nature. In the distance, the crunch of footsteps on leaves.

**ANNETTE** (early 30s, bright, a little lost but eager) appears, struggling with her backpack. She glances around awkwardly, unsure of where to set up camp.

She approaches KYLE, who notices her but pretends to be engrossed in tying a knot.

**ANNETTE**  
*(nervously)*  
Hey, um... I’m kinda new to this. Mind if I set up nearby?

**KYLE**  
*(half-smiling, without looking up)*  
As long as you're not scared of bears.

**ANNETTE**  
(laughing)  
I'll take my chances.

**KYLE** finally looks up and smiles warmly, nodding toward a clear spot nearby.

### EXT. CAMPING GROUND - NIGHT 1 - NIGHTFALL

KYLE and ANNETTE are sitting by a small campfire. The firelight dances on their faces. The stars are starting to peek through the trees. There’s a soft crackle of the fire as they both sip coffee from tin mugs.

**ANNETTE**  
So, why here? Middle of nowhere.

**KYLE**  
I like the quiet. And the stars.  
*(glances up at the sky)*  
Best view in the world, if you ask me.

**ANNETTE**  
Yeah... it is beautiful. I came here because... well, I needed to clear my head, I guess. Things got a little too... noisy back home.

**KYLE**  
Work? Family?

**ANNETTE**  
Life. All of it.  

They sit in silence for a moment, the peacefulness of the forest enveloping them. ANNETTE shivers slightly from the cool night air. KYLE notices.

**KYLE**  
You cold?

He grabs a spare blanket from his pack and tosses it to her.

**ANNETTE**  
Thanks. You’re like... a professional camper or something.

**KYLE**  
Nah, just done it enough to know how not to freeze.  
*(smirking)*  
Though I wouldn’t mind being a guide someday.

They both share a quiet laugh. A sense of comfort begins to form between them.

### EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY 2 - MIDDAY

The sun is high in the sky. KYLE and ANNETTE are hiking together, taking in the majestic view from a ridge. Below them is a lake reflecting the blue of the sky.

**ANNETTE**  
Wow... this is unreal. It’s like we’re on top of the world.

**KYLE**  
You’ve got a good eye for scenery. Most people just snap a photo and move on.

**ANNETTE**  
I want to remember moments like this. Not just in pictures but... in how it feels, you know?

**KYLE**  
Yeah... I do. *(pauses, then smiles at her)*  
You’re different, ANNETTE.

**ANNETTE**  
(surprised)  
Different how?

**KYLE**  
I don’t know. Most people don’t appreciate the small stuff. You... you actually take it in.

They lock eyes for a moment. There’s a silent connection forming. Both of them seem to feel it, but neither says anything more. Instead, they continue hiking side by side.

### EXT. CAMPING GROUND - NIGHT 2 - NIGHT

The campfire is going again, bigger than the night before. KYLE and ANNETTE are sitting closer now, both wrapped in blankets. The fire flickers against the dark canvas of the night.

**ANNETTE**  
I’ve been thinking about what you said... about wanting to be a guide. I think you'd be great at it.

**KYLE**  
You think?

**ANNETTE**  
Yeah. You have this calm, steady vibe. I bet you’d help people feel at ease in the wild.

KYLE looks at her, clearly moved by her words.

**KYLE**  
Thanks, ANNETTE. That means a lot.

They sit quietly again, the silence comfortable. The sound of crickets and the occasional crackle from the fire fill the air. KYLE stares up at the sky.

**KYLE**  
There’s this thing my grandpa used to tell me... about the stars.

**ANNETTE**  
What’s that?

**KYLE**  
He’d say, “Every star’s a moment waiting to happen. All you’ve gotta do is look up.”  

ANNETTE smiles, glancing up at the sky. It’s filled with countless stars.

**ANNETTE**  
Well... here’s to moments waiting to happen.

She lifts her mug in a mock toast. KYLE chuckles and clinks his mug against hers.

### EXT. LAKE SHORE - DAY 3 - SUNSET

They’ve set up near the lake now, ready to watch the sunset. The air is calm, and the sky is streaked with shades of pink, orange, and purple. KYLE is standing by the water, skipping rocks. ANNETTE watches him from a distance, lost in thought.

**ANNETTE**  
(softly)  
You know... I’m glad I came here.

KYLE turns to her, curious.

**ANNETTE**  
I didn’t expect to meet someone like you. Or to feel this... connected. It’s like everything else faded away, and I can actually breathe.

**KYLE**  
I feel it too.

They walk toward each other, the light of the setting sun reflecting on the water behind them. When they reach each other, KYLE gently touches her hand.

**KYLE**  
What if we kept this moment going? After this trip. What if...

He hesitates, unsure of how to finish.

**ANNETTE**  
*(smiling warmly)*  
I think I’d like that.

### EXT. CAMPING GROUND - NIGHT 3 - NIGHT

The final night of the trip. They sit by the fire, much closer now. There’s an undeniable warmth between them, not just from the flames. KYLE glances at her, then reaches into his pocket, pulling out a small wooden carving of a star.

**KYLE**  
I... made this for you. It’s kinda cheesy, I know, but...

**ANNETTE**  
*(surprised, touched)*  
It’s not cheesy at all. It’s beautiful.

KYLE places the star in her hand, their fingers lingering.

**ANNETTE**  
You really believe in that star thing, huh?

**KYLE**  
*(laughs lightly)*  
I do now.

They look at each other, eyes locking. Slowly, they lean in, sharing their first kiss under the same stars they’d admired together.

### INT. SMALL OUTDOOR WEDDING - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

A small, intimate gathering of friends and family in a meadow surrounded by trees. KYLE and ANNETTE stand at the altar, holding hands, both glowing with happiness. The officiant speaks, but their attention is entirely on each other.

**OFFICIANT**  
KYLE and ANNETTE, from the first night under the stars to this moment before your loved ones, you’ve written your own love story.

KYLE and ANNETTE exchange a knowing glance.

**OFFICIANT**  
And now, it’s time to begin the next chapter. KYLE, do you take ANNETTE to be your wife?

**KYLE**  
I do.

**OFFICIANT**  
And ANNETTE, do you take KYLE to be your husband?

**ANNETTE**  
I do.

They smile, both brimming with joy.

**OFFICIANT**  
Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss!

KYLE and ANNETTE kiss as their friends cheer. Above them, the sky is a brilliant blue, with just a hint of starlight still lingering in the distance.

### EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT - LATER THAT EVENING

The newlyweds sit alone by a small fire, much like the one from their camping trip. They look up at the stars.

**ANNETTE**  
You were right, you know.

**KYLE**  
About what?

**ANNETTE**  
The stars. They were a moment waiting to happen.

KYLE wraps an arm around her, pulling her close.

**KYLE**  
Here’s to a lifetime of them.

They sit in silence, gazing up at the stars together, content in their new beginning.

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END**
